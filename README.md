# Item Frequency Tracker

## Project Summary

The **Item Frequency Tracker** is a C++ program designed to read item data from an input file, calculate and store the frequency of each item, and allow users to interact with the data. Users can query the frequency of a specific item, list all items with their frequencies, or display a histogram of the items based on their frequencies. Additionally, the program supports saving the frequency data to a backup file.

## Problem Solved

This program solves the problem of efficiently tracking, storing, and displaying the frequency of items from a dataset, allowing users to quickly interact with the data through a simple menu system. By using a map to store item frequencies, it ensures fast lookups, and the program handles basic file input/output to persist the data. This solution can be useful in applications where item tracking and frequency reporting are needed, such as inventory management systems or data analysis tools.

## What Went Well

The program successfully implements the core functionality of:
- Reading item data from an input file.
- Storing and accumulating frequencies using a `std::map`.
- Providing a user-friendly interactive menu for querying item frequencies, listing all items, and displaying a histogram.
- Writing the frequency data to a backup file for persistence.

The use of `std::map` ensures efficient frequency accumulation and lookup, and the program operates correctly under normal conditions, providing accurate results.

## Enhancements & Improvements

While the program works well, there are several areas where it could be improved for efficiency, security, and scalability:

### 1. **Input Validation and Error Handling**  
   - **Current Issue**: The program does not handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values for menu options).
   - **Improvement**: Adding robust input validation would prevent runtime errors caused by invalid user input and improve the user experience.

### 2. **Security Enhancements**  
   - **Current Issue**: There is no sanitization of file or item names, which could lead to potential security issues (e.g., path traversal attacks).
   - **Improvement**: Sanitizing user inputs would enhance the security of the program, especially if it were expanded to handle external input or integrated into a larger system.

### 3. **Optimizing File I/O**  
   - **Current Issue**: The program uses synchronous file reading and writing, which can be slow for large datasets.
   - **Improvement**: Implementing asynchronous or buffered I/O operations could improve performance when dealing with large datasets.

### 4. **Memory Optimization**  
   - **Current Issue**: The program uses standard containers which are adequate for smaller datasets, but may be less efficient for very large datasets.
   - **Improvement**: More memory-efficient data structures could be considered for handling larger datasets or when running in memory-constrained environments.

## Challenges Faced

The most challenging aspect of this project was ensuring the correct accumulation of item frequencies from the input file. Handling the file format and properly updating the frequencies required careful parsing and logic. Additionally, displaying the histogram with proper formatting (such as alignment of item names) required extra attention to detail to ensure it was visually clear.

## Tools and Resources Used

- **C++ Standard Library**: Used for file I/O, data storage (`std::map`), and string handling.
- **Stack Overflow**: For troubleshooting common issues with file handling and input/output operations.
- **C++ Documentation**: To reference function behaviors and best practices for using `std::map` and other standard library features.

## Transferable Skills

Several key skills gained from this project are transferable to other software development tasks, including:
- **Efficient use of data structures** (e.g., maps and vectors) for problem-solving.
- **File handling and persistent storage** for saving and loading data.
- **Input validation** to ensure the robustness and reliability of a program.
- **User interface design** for creating simple, interactive menu-driven programs.
These skills are highly relevant for other coursework and real-world applications involving data processing, inventory systems, and more.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, the following practices were followed:
- **Modular Design**: The program is divided into clear functions and a class (`ItemTracker`), making it easier to modify or extend the functionality.
- **Descriptive Naming**: Variable and function names are meaningful and clearly describe their purpose, improving readability.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for file operations is implemented, ensuring the program fails gracefully if issues arise.
- **Extensibility**: The program structure makes it easy to add additional features, such as editing item frequencies, removing items, or adding more complex reporting options.

By following these practices, the code remains clean and easy to maintain, and new features can be added with minimal disruption.
